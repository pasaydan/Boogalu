                    We know you’ll love BOOGALUU, but we also understand that it’s not always a perfect fit for everyone. If you're unsatisfied with your recent BOOGALUU subscription purchase or you decide that you’d like to close your subscription plan, our Support Team will be more than happy to issue a refund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>In order to be eligible for a refund, you must contact us within 3 working days of the transaction date.</strong> Your subscription will close immediately upon being refunded for your payment. Our team is not responsible for any different in amount refunded due to currency exchange rates for our international payments. Refunds for online courses are only given under the following circumstances:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The student/user did not access any portion of the online course AND the student/user requests a refund, in writing via email within three business days from the date of the registration (email notification sent). There will be no refunds for any online courses (or curricula) once a course has been accessed in any manner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refund will be issued after deducting 40% of course fees as administrative fee and 100% GST amount. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please understand that with the enrollment and accessing of your online course, you have read and agree to the aforementioned refund policy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, subscriptions created from the Apple App Store are processed and controlled directly by Apple, so we are unable to issue any refunds from our end. You can, however, cancel your subscription and request a refund from Apple.

While we cannot guarantee that Apple will issue a refund, we have seen success from members when they submit multiple refunds if their initial requests are denied.

                <p>
                    We’d like to inform you that issuing a refund is a process that can only be done by our Support Team. Simply cancelling or deleting the BOOGALUU app will not trigger a refund. You can expect your refund to be issued back to your bank/lender within 5 - 10 business days. If you are still without your refund, we encourage you to reach back out to verify the status of your refund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        There are times when banks will decide to remove the charge altogether, rather than issuing a refund, so please check with your bank/lender to see if a removal occurred instead.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The decision to issue a refund and any subsequent actions regarding your subscription plan is ultimately up to the discretion of the Support Team, so we encourage you to reach out to us about any unique circumstances and/or situations.
