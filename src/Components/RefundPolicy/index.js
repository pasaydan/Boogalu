                    Students who register for a training course occasionally change their mind for one reason or another. Regardless of the reason, we believe there should be a definite refund policy for students who decide not to take the course. Refunds for online courses are only given under the following circumstances:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The student/user did not access any portion of the online course AND the student/user requests a refund, in writing via email within three business days from the date of the registration (email notification sent). There will be no refunds for any online courses (or curricula) once a course has been accessed in any manner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A full refund will be issued less an administrative fee of 50%. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please understand that with the enrollment and accessing of your online course, you have read and agree to the aforementioned refund policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If youâ€™ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@boogaluu.com">info@boogaluu.com</a>.
